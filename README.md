# MaxMin-CNN-_CIFAR10

This repository contains implementation of the paper [MaxMin Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07882) for CIFAR10 dataset achieving the accuracy of 91.43%.

## How to use it?

The notebook is self explanatory. I coded this network in Google Colab. There are mentions of 2 h5 files which are the saved weights of the model which are not needed for training . 

## Implementation 

The implementation is done using Keras. Training is done using Google Colaboratory.

### Any suggestions or queries are appreciated!!
